# What is this?

This pack replaces the old and boring Wandering Trader with 9 different varieties of Wandering Traders, with their custom trades related to the region they come from. Bet you've never seen a Beekeeping trader before.

To prevent players from acquiring dimensional items before entering the corresponding dimension, the Nether and End traders will only accept currency from their respective dimensions.

# List of regions and trades
